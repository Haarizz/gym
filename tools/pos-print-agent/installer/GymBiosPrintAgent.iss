; GymBios POS Print Agent — Inno Setup installer script
; Compile with Inno Setup 6 (https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php):
;   iscc installer\GymBiosPrintAgent.iss
; Produces installer\output\GymBiosPrintAgentSetup.exe
;
; Prerequisite: run `npm run build` first so dist\GymBiosPrintAgent.exe exists.

#define MyAppName "GymBios Print Agent"
; Keep this in lockstep with tools/pos-print-agent/package.json "version" and the
; agent's GET /health response — the whole point of the version is that a till's
; Add/Remove-Programs entry and /health agree on which build is deployed. Bump
; both together on every agent change. (Was hardcoded 0.1.0 while the agent was
; already 0.4.0, so installed tills reported a version that matched nothing.)
#define MyAppVersion "0.4.0"
#define MyAppPublisher "GymBios"
#define MyAppExeName "GymBiosPrintAgent.exe"

[UninstallRun]
; Best-effort stop of a running agent before files are removed, so the
; uninstaller doesn't leave a locked/orphaned GymBiosPrintAgent.exe behind.
; taskkill exits non-zero when there's nothing to kill (or on a race losing to
; the process already exiting) — "& exit 0" keeps that from failing the
; uninstall itself, and the timeout gives the OS a moment to release the file
; handle before Inno tries to delete the exe.
